The goal of this project is to repurpose a Logitech webcam as a laser beam 
viewing and characterization tool.

Included are two python scripts and an ipython notebook. The notebook 
contains three different laser beam analysis tools: real-time beam 
brightness, diameter, and centroid retrieval. The scripts, annulus.py and 
moving_beam.py, display an annulus of varying brightness and outer 
diameter, and a moving Gaussian beam. These scripts can serve as tests for 
the webcam beam analysis tools.

This project was demonstrated in-person, rather than using a screencapture.
